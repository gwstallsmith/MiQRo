# QR-Code-Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository hosts a project aimed at efficiently organizing laboratory materials using QR codes. The project leverages QR code technology to streamline the tracking and management of various materials within a laboratory setting. Whether you are a researcher, scientist, or laboratory manager, this tool provides a user-friendly solution to enhance organization and reduce the chances of errors.

## Features

- **QR Code Generation**: Easily generate QR codes for different laboratory materials, including reagents, samples, equipment, and more.

- **Material Database**: Maintain a centralized database to store information about each material, such as name, description, quantity, and expiration date.

- **Scan and Update**: Use a QR code scanner to quickly scan materials and update their status, helping to keep inventory accurate in real-time.

- **Search and Filter**: Efficiently search and filter materials based on various criteria, making it convenient to locate specific items within the laboratory.

- **User Authentication**: Implement secure user authentication to control access and ensure that only authorized personnel can make changes to the material database.
